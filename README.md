## Problem Statement

Since the covid online market has taken a boom. That boom has created a never-ending need of buying products from online. ​

​ Due to this scenario there are many site online like Amazon , Flipkart ,  Croma etc which are offering products at best price. Hence this leads to a lot of competion which results into a price of a product changing every day.​

​ However said that this all leads to a lot of confusion and people really waste a lot of time for searching the best price for the laptop or phone that they are willing to buy.​

​ So, to solve this problem once and for all we came up with Budget Buyers. ​

## Solution and approach

To solve this problem, we are planning to create a NextGen website that will contain multiple products along with the prices on different site.​

​ For example, if you won’t to buy a MacBook 14 then you can simply go through budget buyers and see all the prices from Amazon, Flipkart, Croma store or even from Apple site as well.​

​ So, there is no more searching for the best price for a product. Right now, we have included only laptops, but we can start adding multiple varieties of products.​
